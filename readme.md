# Advent of Code 2024 Solvers in TypeScrip with Deno

Yet another year of me solving the Advent of Code puzzles. Honestly, I'm well aware I'll probably grow bored before solving all 25 days but we'll see how far I get this year. This time I'm using the opportunity to check out Deno 2 and practice making CLI tools with it.

Each day will have its own file with part1 and part2 functions. I'll add multipart comments to explain my initial thoughts and the solution I arrived at, along with any problems I ran into along the way. While this repo and the code within tends to be scrappier than my usual work, I'll try to keep things relatively readable while introducing optimizations as needed to keep the runtime reasonable.
